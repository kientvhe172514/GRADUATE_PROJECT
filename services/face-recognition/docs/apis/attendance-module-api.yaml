  title: Attendance Management API
  description: |
    This API manages the automated attendance process within the Zentry system,
    leveraging mobile devices as virtual BLE beacons. It covers initiating attendance sessions,
    processing presence based on BLE signals (real-time and offline-buffered),
    handling absence reports, and enabling manual corrections by lecturers.

    ### Key Features:
    - **Session Initiation (UC-Attendance-01)**: Lecturers can start attendance sessions based on their assigned schedules.
    - **Real-time Scan Submission (UC-Attendance-02)**: Devices (student or lecturer) submit single processed BLE scan data for immediate attendance processing.
    - **Offline Scan Synchronization (UC-Attendance-02 - extended)**: Devices (student or lecturer) bulk-submit buffered BLE scan data collected during offline periods.
    - **Attendance Data Retrieval (UC-Attendance-04)**: Lecturers and Admins can view detailed attendance records for specific sessions.
    - **Student Attendance Check (UC-Attendance-06)**: Students can check their own attendance status and successful rounds.
    - **Student Absence Reporting (UC-Attendance-07)**: Students can report unjustified absences within a grace period.
    - **Manual Attendance Correction (UC-Attendance-08)**: Lecturers can manually adjust attendance status based on student reports.

    The module integrates with DeviceManagement for device authentication, Schedule module for session linking,
    and Configuration for system parameters. Data flows through Redis (temporary) and MongoDB (1-day retention)
    for processing, with core structured data in PostgreSQL.
