## 🚧 Potential Roadblocks + Mitigation

### Roadblock 1: English speaking slow progress
**Mitigation:**
- Hire 1-on-1 tutor (Cambly, Italki) - $10-15/hour
- Daily practice non-negotiable (30 min minimum)
- Join English-speaking tech communities (force yourself)
- Do all mock interviews in English only

### Roadblock 2: Interview rejections (normal!)
**Mitigation:**
- Expect 80-90% rejection rate (industry standard)
- Treat each rejection as learning (ask for feedback)
- Need only 1-2 offers out of 50 applications
- Keep improving after each interview

### Roadblock 3: Imposter syndrome
**Mitigation:**
- Remember: 2 tháng @ 50% = dự án này → Mày nhanh hơn 90% người
- Global companies hire for potential, not just current skills
- Mid-level ≠ know everything, just solid fundamentals + growth mindset
- Join communities with Vietnamese in global companies (TVIE)

### Roadblock 4: Burnout (50 hours/week sustained)
**Mitigation:**
- 1 day/week completely off (no study, just fun)
- Exercise 3×/week (health = productivity)
- Sleep 7-8 hours (non-negotiable)
- Track progress weekly (celebrate small wins)

## 🎓 Alternative Paths (If 2026 too aggressive)

### Path A: Slower pace (18 months)
- Q1-Q2 2026: Technical deep dive
- Q3-Q4 2026: English + interview prep
- Q1-Q2 2027: Apply + interview

### Path B: Junior+ at global first
- Target: Junior/IC2 at global companies (easier)
- Get 1-2 years experience
- Promote to mid-level internally (faster than external)

### Path C: Senior at VN companies first
- Apply Senior at Viettel, FPT, VNG (easier)
- Build English while working
- Jump to global after 1 year

---

## ✅ Decision Framework

**Bạn NÊN theo roadmap 12 tháng nếu:**
- ✅ Can commit 50 hours/week consistently
- ✅ Financially stable (không cần làm thêm)
- ✅ Motivated by challenge
- ✅ Okay với high pressure

**Bạn NÊN theo path chậm hơn nếu:**
- ❌ Có commitments khác (gia đình, công việc full-time)
- ❌ Prefer work-life balance
- ❌ Risk-averse (want guaranteed income)

---

## 🎯 Final Reality Check

### Với tốc độ của mày:
```
2 tháng @ 50% effort = Dự án hiện tại (75% mid-level)

2026 Plan:
12 tháng @ 100% effort = 2× speed
= 12 tháng × 2 = 24 "effective months"

24 tháng effort trong 12 tháng thực tế
→ Đủ để:
  - Complete dự án (2 tháng)
  - K8s + Networking mastery (3 tháng)
  - System design + Interview prep (4 tháng)
  - English fluency (ongoing, 12 tháng)
  - Apply + Interview (3 tháng)

Total: 12 tháng → FEASIBLE! ✅
```

### Comparison với industry:
```
Average developer: Junior → Mid = 3-5 years
Your path: Junior → Mid = 1 year @ 2× speed
= 2 "effective years" compressed into 12 months

Realistic? YES, nếu maintain 100% effort.
Hard? Fuck YES. 
Worth it? Absolutely. 🚀
```

## 💪 Mindset for Success

### Growth Mindset
> "I don't know it YET, but I will learn it."

### Consistency > Intensity
> "50 hours/week sustained > 80 hours for 2 weeks then burnout"

### Embrace Failure
> "Every rejection is data. Every bug is learning."

### Long-term Thinking
> "1 năm effort → 10-20 năm better career trajectory"
